== Installation ==

For a complete setup guide take a look at: https://booking-calendar-plugin.com/setup-guide/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQNN6cX6NwM

1. Install and activate the plugin through your WordPress admin.
2. Check the settings on the "Advanced Booking Calendar" settings page.
3. Create calendars, rooms and seasons.
4. Add shortcodes and widget.

= Shortcodes =
This plugin uses four different shortcodes you can put on your pages. We recommend to use one page for each shortcode.

* Calendar Overview / **[abc-overview]**
The shortcode [abc-overview] shows all calendars and there availabilities by month.
* Single Calendar / **[abc-single calendar=X]**
The shortcode [abc-single calendar=X] needs a calendar id instead of X. You can find the ids on your calendar settings page. Example [abc-single calendar=1]
* Booking form / **[abc-bookingform]**
The booking form fulfils two tasks: finding the right room for users and generating booking requests. Every user action happens onpage via AJAX, so the page does not reload during interactions. We recommend to enter the shortcode [abc-bookingform] on a single page.

= Widget =
You can also use an availability check widget. Just go to "Appearance / Widgets" and add the widget.
